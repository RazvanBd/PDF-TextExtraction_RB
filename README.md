# PDF-TextExtraction_RB


ðŸ“„ PDF Text Extraction Toolkit (WIP)

This project is a work-in-progress toolkit for extracting text from PDF documents. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible solution that supports multiple text extraction strategies, with future support for table and image detection as well.

ðŸš§ Project Status

Currently in early development stages â€” the architecture is still evolving.
Now i convert pdf in images and use simple tesseract ocr to extract text

ðŸŽ¯ Key Goals (Roadmap):

- Store results in Database for easy statistics

- Connect with Local storage or cloud storage like AWS to process documents

-Implement various text extraction techniques (e.g. OCR, layout-aware parsing, etc.)

-Enable users to choose and benchmark different extraction methods

-Add support for table and image detection

-Provide an evaluation and benchmarking component to help users select the most suitable extraction strategy for their needs

-This repository will grow over time with new capabilities, improved modularity, and detailed documentation.
